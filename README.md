Berthing-Energy-cacualtion:

This program calculates the berthing energy of a ship during impact with a berth or jetty. It helps in fender design by estimating how much energy the fender system must absorb to safely stop the vessel.

Inputs Required:

DWT (Deadweight tonnage): total carrying capacity of the ship
Approach velocity (V): ship’s speed while berthing (m/s)
Ship dimensions: Length (L), Breadth (B), Depth (D)
Approach angle (θ): angle between ship and berth
Factor of Safety (FOS)
Distance (l): between center of gravity (CG) and point of contact
Radius of gyration (r)

Calculation:

Displacement tonnage (based on DWT ratio)
Added mass coefficient (cm): accounts for water mass moving with the ship
Eccentricity coefficient (ce): corrects for off-center impact
Berthing Energy (B_E)

Output

Berthing energy (Tonne–meter)
Ultimate berthing energy (with safety factor)
